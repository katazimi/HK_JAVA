			<h1>QUALITY COFFEE, QUALITY CAFFEINE</h1>
			<p>
				At Starbuzz Coffee, we are dedicated to filling all your  caffeine needs through our
				quality coffees and teas. Sure, we want you to have a great cup of coffee and a great
				coffee experience as well, but we're the only company that actively monitors and
				optimizes caffeine levels. So stop by and fill your cup, or order online with our new Bean
				Machine online order form, and get that quality Starbuzz coffee that you know will meet
				your caffeine standards.
			</p>
			<p>
				And, did we mention <em>caffeine</em>? We've just started funding the guys doing all
				the wonderful research at the Caffeine Buzz.
				If you want the latest on coffee and other caffeine products,
				stop by and pay them a visit.
			</p>
			<h1>OUR STORY</h1>
			<p>
				"A man, a plan, a coffee bean". Okay, that doesn't make a palindrome, but it resulted
				in a damn good cup of coffee.  Starbuzz's CEO is that man, and you already know his
				plan: a Starbuzz on every corner.
			</p>
			<p>
				In only a few years he's executed that plan and today
				you can enjoy Starbuzz just about anywhere.  And, of course, the big news this year
				is that Starbuzz teamed up with Head First readers to create Starbuzz's Web presence,
				which is growing rapidly and helping to meet the caffeine needs of a whole new set of
				customers.
			</p>
			<h1>STARBUZZ COFFEE BEVERAGES</h1>
			<p>
				We've got a variety of caffeinated beverages to choose
				from at Starbuzz, including our House Blend, Mocha Cafe Latte,
				Cappuccino, and a favorite of our customers, Chai Tea.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also offer a variety of coffee beans, whole or ground, for you to
				take home with you.  Order your coffee today using our online
				Bean Machine, and take
				the Starbuzz Coffee experience home.
